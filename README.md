**Key Responsibilities:**  
- Define project scope, milestones, and deliverables.  
- Coordinate between developers, QA, and DevOps.  
- Track progress and manage risks.  
- Facilitate communication with stakeholders.  

---

### UI/UX Designer (from ITRex roles)
Even though this project focuses on backend, designers play a role in defining how the frontend will interact with APIs. They help ensure backend endpoints align with user experience needs.  

**Key Responsibilities:**  
- Provide wireframes and API interaction flows.  
- Collaborate with backend developers on data needs.  
- Ensure consistency between frontend design and backend data structures.  

---

### Business Analyst (from ITRex roles)
Analyzes requirements and ensures the backend supports business logic and user needs. They translate business goals into technical tasks.  

**Key Responsibilities:**  
- Gather and refine requirements.  
- Translate business processes into backend logic.  
- Ensure features align with Airbnb‚Äôs clone goals.  
- Collaborate with QA to validate business rules.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone project uses a modern and scalable technology stack to deliver backend services efficiently:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend RESTful APIs and handle business logic.  
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Provides tools to easily create RESTful APIs, handle authentication, and serialize/deserialize data.  
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for storing structured data such as users, properties, bookings, and reviews.  
- **GraphQL**: Enables flexible and efficient querying of backend data, allowing clients to request only the data they need.  
- **Celery**: A task queue used for managing asynchronous tasks, such as sending notifications or processing background jobs.  
- **Redis**: An in-memory data store used for caching, session management, and supporting Celery tasks.  
- **Docker**: Provides containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates testing, integration, and deployment of code changes to maintain reliability and speed in development.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

The project database is structured around key entities that represent users, listings, and transactions:

- **Users**  
  - Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `date_joined`  
  - Relationship: A user can create multiple properties, make bookings, and leave reviews.  

- **Properties**  
  - Fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`  
  - Relationship: A property belongs to a user (host) and can have multiple bookings and reviews.  

- **Bookings**  
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status`  
  - Relationship: A booking is linked to one user and one property.  

- **Payments**  
  - Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `payment_status`  
  - Relationship: A payment is associated with one booking.  

- **Reviews**  
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`  
  - Relationship: A review belongs to a user and a property.

## üõ†Ô∏è Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone backend supports the following core features:

- **User Management**  
  Allows users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles. This ensures secure access to the platform and provides a personalized experience.  

- **Property Management**  
  Hosts can create, update, and manage property listings. This feature is central to allowing users to discover and book available properties.  

- **Booking System**  
  Users can book properties, modify booking details, and manage check-in/check-out information. This system ensures that reservations are tracked and managed effectively.  

- **Payment Processing**  
  Handles financial transactions securely. It ensures that hosts are paid, and users‚Äô bookings are confirmed only after payment is processed.  

- **Review System**  
  Enables users to leave reviews and ratings for properties they stayed in. Reviews build trust in the platform and guide future guests in their booking decisions.  

- **Data Optimization**  
  Implements caching, indexing, and query optimization to improve response times and scalability of the application.

## üîê API Security

Security is crucial for protecting sensitive data and ensuring trust in the platform. The project will implement the following measures:

- **Authentication & Authorization**  
  Only registered users can access protected endpoints, and permissions ensure users can only perform actions relevant to their role (e.g., host vs guest).  

- **Data Protection**  
  Passwords are stored securely using hashing algorithms, and sensitive user data is protected through encryption where necessary.  

- **Rate Limiting**  
  Prevents abuse of APIs by limiting the number of requests per user/IP, helping protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  

- **Payment Security**  
  Payment data is processed securely following industry standards (e.g., PCI compliance), ensuring transactions are safe and fraud-resistant.

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

A **CI/CD pipeline** automates the process of integrating new code, running tests, and deploying updates, ensuring faster and more reliable releases.  

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically tests and validates code changes when developers push to the repository.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Deploys successfully tested changes to production or staging environments with minimal manual effort.  

**Tools for the project:**  
- **GitHub Actions:** For automating builds, tests, and deployments directly from GitHub.  
- **Docker:** For containerization, ensuring the app runs consistently across environments.  
- **Monitoring Tools (optional):** Such as Prometheus or Grafana to track application health post-deployment.
